# üê± Cat Photo App

My first project built with HTML basics, completed as part of the **freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design** certification.

## Live Demo
 [View the project here](https://vladimirovatsvetelina49-cpu.github.io/cat-photo-app/)

## What I Learned
- Basic HTML structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Headings, paragraphs, and images
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Forms with inputs, checkboxes, and radio buttons
- Semantic tags (`main`, `section`, `figure`, `figcaption`)

## Next Steps
- Add CSS styling (colors, spacing, layout)
- Make it responsive with Flexbox & Grid
